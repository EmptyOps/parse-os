# ParseOS  
**Open-source automation with purpose.**

---

## Description  
ParseOS is an open-source initiative to advance automation at the OS level.  
We do not pay for research; instead, our focus is on creating value by helping students and professionals start strong in data science and machine learning.  
Our goal is to foster a positive shift in tech through collaboration and shared learning.

---

## 🎯 Goals
Below are the broad technical and community goals of the OS Automation project.  
Our focus is to build a smooth, flexible, and cost-effective automation system that can be confidently used in production environments while staying open-source and community-driven.

🔹 1. Build Smooth & Production-Ready Automation  
Our first and foremost goal is to make operating system automation as smooth and reliable as possible.  
We focus on using open-source solutions and tools that work efficiently in real-world, production-level systems — not just prototypes or demos.

🔹 2. Create a Flexible & Extensible Architecture  
We design the system architecture to be highly modular and flexible, allowing easy integration or replacement of components.  
This makes it simple to adopt new popular tools, MCP-based solutions, or open-source alternatives in the future without breaking the existing system.

🔹 3. Keep It Cost-Effective and Scalable  
A key goal is to make the system cost-efficient without compromising performance.  
We aim to reduce unnecessary API calls, heavy dependencies, and overhead so that users can run automation tasks at low operational cost while still being scalable for production use.

🔹 4. Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility  
OS Automation is built with the goal of supporting multiple operating systems and environments.  
Whether users are on Linux, macOS, or Windows, our target is to deliver consistent behavior and easy setup across all supported platforms.

🔹 5. Strengthen Testing & Reliability  
We aim to include robust testing, logging, and validation mechanisms to ensure each automation command behaves predictably.  
Error handling and retry logic are part of our core design to make the system production-ready and self-healing.

🔹 6. Improve Developer Experience & Documentation  
We want every developer to get started easily.  
Comprehensive documentation, clear examples, and simple “getting started” commands are part of our ongoing goal to make automation beginner-friendly and transparent.

🔹 7. Build an Open Community  
Our long-term vision includes growing an open developer community that collaborates, contributes new automation modules, and improves the ecosystem together.  
Open collaboration ensures that OS Automation evolves through shared knowledge, transparency, and innovation.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

To get started, just run the following command in your terminal:

python -m os_automation.cli.cli run "open browser and search for python tutorials"

💡 What it does:  
This command automatically opens your browser and searches for Python tutorials — helping you start learning Python right away!

🪄 Step-by-Step (for Beginners):  

First, clone this repository to your system using:  

git clone <repo_url>  

Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  
Open your terminal or command prompt.  
Navigate into the cloned project folder.  
Run the following command:  
python -m os_automation.cli.cli run "open browser and search for python tutorials"  
Press Enter, and the automation will take care of the rest!

## 🏗️ Architecture – How It’s Built  
Three AI Agents (Main Planner, OmniParserEventExecutor, Validator).  
Task Abstraction Layer (TAL) — the shared contract schema between all agents.  
Adapters — thin wrappers that let you plug in any repo or model without rewriting the system.  
Registry — keeps track of which adapters are available.  
Stays open and modular, so you can swap repositories, models, or tools (AskUI, ShowUI, OpenComputerUse, OS-Atlas, Sikuli, MCP-native tools).  
Is future-proof (ready to integrate new tools easily).

## 🧩 Contribution Guide  
We welcome contributions of all sizes — from documentation fixes to major feature improvements.  
Please follow the simple flow below to keep reviews fast and collaboration smooth.

---

### ⚙️ 1. Standard Contribution Flow  

Fork and Clone  

	git clone https://github.com/EmptyOps/temp-parse-os.git  
	cd temp-parse-os  
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/<main-org>/temp-parse-os.git  

Create a New Branch  

	git checkout -b issue/your-issue-name  

Branches help keep your changes separate from the main code.  
Create a new branch whenever you fix a bug, add a new feature, or improve existing code — this keeps your work clean and easy to review.

Make and Test Changes  

Follow the project’s coding and commit style.  
Run existing tests or add new ones if needed.

Push and Create Pull Request (PR)  

	git push origin feature/your-feature-name  

Go to your fork on GitHub → Click “Compare & pull request”.  

Use a clear title (e.g. feat: add plugin manager)  

After Submitting PR  

Maintainers will check your PR in a few days.  
If they ask for changes, make updates in the same branch.  
After approval, it will be squash-merged into the main branch to keep history clean.
